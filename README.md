This Project is part of the first testing in our team.  #### THIS IS JUST A TEST, NOT THE FINAL SCRIPT MODEL ####

As the description suggests A PYTHON SCRIPT NEEDED TO BE DEVELOPED TO CREATE A K8S SECRET YAML DEFINITION. 

Please note that no yaml file was created manually. The idea was to create such definition by running the python code accordingly. 

The json file had to be modified to run the code properly using PYTHON3  instead of python.
